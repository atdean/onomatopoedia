The Onomatopoedia

It's like Urban Dictionaryâ€¦ but for onomatopoeias! More details coming soon...

This project uses Gulp and Sass to compile CSS files. Make sure to have node/npm and global Gulp installed, do an `npm install` and then `gulp build` to compile the stylesheet.

To run the project, from the root directory execute `go run cmd/web/main.go` and the app will listen on localhost:8080.

This is extremely early in development, not much to see yet ;)
